    <h2 class="tt">Tell me how you managed to combine preparation for the competition and study, because there was a session?</h2>
    <p class="an"> My classmates say I have 40 hours a day. I believe that the key to success is properly planned
        time. For me, time management is an integral part of life. The main thing is a full â€“ fledged dream, if I
        sleep well, I'll move mountains. I would like to note that I studied hard for a whole semester and that is why I am preparing for
        exams was given me without sleepless nights and panic. It was a good experience to combine such important events
        in my life, Miss Kazan coped with the Golden session.
    </p>
    <h2 class="tt">What was included in the preparation, what was the most difficult?</h2>
    <p class="an">Probably, before the story about the preparation for the competition is to tell about the selection. The first took place on December 24,
        it was an open casting in MEGA Kazan shopping center, where 120 girls chose the preliminary composition of the finalists from 42
        man. For Kazan girls was held intermediate stage of Beauty Round, where Miss Bikini and Miss Talent were chosen.
        I became the owner of the first title, again work, work and only work on myself helped me to win this
        title. 17th January was the final casting, where they selected 31 girl. And here rehearsals in GRK Riviera began. Started
        all at 9: 00, we were taught to stay on stage, nice to walk, talk and of course, charged with incredible energy,
        motivation. Thank you Christine and Michael Volkonskogo and Sakharova Isolde Genieva and Irina
        Nikolayev, without whom I would not have received this title. We were also given lessons by Miss Tatarstan and Miss Kazan of the past
        years. Everything ended at 20: 00. And so every day until January 24. I didn't treat the competition like something.
        complex. I looked at this stage as an opportunity to improve and therefore enjoyed it.</p>

    <h2 class="tt">How long have you been modeling?</h2>
    <p class="an">I have been modeling since I was 14 years old, I like it very much! Just miss Tatarstan competition in 2013 became
        the starting point of my career.</p>

    <h2 class="tt">Do you personally have any signs, traditions, for good luck?</h2>
    <p class="an">My life hack: if I have a goal, I imagine I have already achieved it. So it was with exams, so it was with
        competition. I went to him with the idea that I had already won, probably, it helped me to stay very confident, believe in
        myself and achieve what I was going to. And I want to note that the desire is not enough, work on yourself played also
        important role.</p>
    <h2 class="tt"> What are your impressions of the competition?</h2>
    <p class="an"> Only positive! It's an indescribable emotion when I went on stage, I was applauded, all the attention was
        I got goosebumps from how cool it is! I'm incredibly happy! Girls, if your parameters satisfy
        terms of the competition, I advise you to go to the casting. Because this you will not find anywhere else.
